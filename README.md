## Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib)
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL)
- **Power BI**
- **Git & GitHub**

## What has been done
- Collected multiple datasets from World Bank Open Data and performed initial exploratory analysis.
- Consolidated and standardized the data into unified population and economics datasets using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
- Created SQL queries to extract insights and validate analytical assumptions.
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard presenting key metrics for each country, subregion, and region across 1960–2024.
- Published the dashboard and created a GitHub repository to document and share the project.

## Some Interesting Insights:
- In 2024, Africa's population will account for 19% of the total, while its GDP will account for only 2.5% of global GDP.
- The biggest gap: in 2023, the life expectancy of men in Ukraine (66.9 years) is expected to be 13 years less than that of women (80.2 years).
- The poverty rate fell from 47.1% in 1981 to 10.3% in 2024.
- In 2004, nine European countries were among the top ten countries in terms of GDP per capita. In 2024, there will be only five.
- In the year Poland joined the EU (2004), the unemployment rate reached 19%. In 2024, this figure stood at 2.8%.
